RELEASE 1.2.x SHOWSTOPPERS:


CURRENT VOTES:


CURRENT test/testall -v EXCEPTIONS:

    Please add any platform anomilies to the following exception list.

    * 'testipsub' will tickle an Solaris 8 getaddrinfo() IPv6 bug,
      causing the test to hang.  Configure with --disable-ipv6 if
      using an unpatched Solaris 8 installation.

    * The 'testdso' tests will not work if configured with
      --disable-shared since the loadable modules cannot be built.

    * 'testdso' fails on older versions of OpenBSD due to dlsym(NULL,
      ...) segfaulting.

    * Win32 Not Implemented tests 
        Pipes: set_timeout/read_write; can't timeout blocking pipes
        Socket Creation: tcp6_socket and udp6_socket (at least by default)
        Socket Options: corkable: TCP isn't corkable
        Users: username: Groups from apr_uid_get not implemented

    * Win32 tests are known to crash when APR_HAVE_IPV6 but there is no
      ipv6 adapter is loaded (even loopback is sufficient).  There are
      obnoxious getaddrinfo() missing results from looking up a fixed
      IPv4-IPv6 mixed notation address that reflect a Winsock bug.


SEE svn.apache.org:/repos/asf/apr/apr/trunk/STATUS for all other open
issues to be addressed.  [First, patched in trunk; then considered for
backport to the stable branch.]
