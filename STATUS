RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * Source code layout needs to be decided for apr and apr-util.  There
      has been some discussion about adding a src/ directory to apr or 
      removing it from apr-util/.  Either way, this needs to be decided.

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * SysV semaphore support isn't usable by Apache when started as
      root because we don't have a way to allow the semaphore to be
      used by the configured User and Group.  Current work-around:
      change the initial permissions to 0666.  Needed code:  See
      1.3's http_main.c, SysV sem flavor of accept_mutex_init().

    * Build scripts do not recognise AIX 4.2.1 pthreads

    * Win32: Implement ap_shm_ functions 

    * Bill says we need a new procattr, APR_CREATE_SUSPENDED (or
      something similar) to direct ap_create_process to create the
      process suspended. We also need a call to wake up the suspended 
      process This may not be able to be implemented everywhere though.

    * Replace tables with a proper opaque ADT that has pluggable
      implementations (including something like the existing data type,
      plus hash tables for speed, with options for more later).
	Status: fanf is working on this.

    * add a version number to apr_initialize() as an extra failsafe against
      (APR) library version skew.

      Status: Greg +1 (volunteers), Jeff +1, Ryan +1, Tony -0(?)

    * The MM library is built as static and shared library. This should
      be set up to build only the required version.

    * use libtool
        Status: Greg +1 (volunteers), Ryan +1(?)
	Waiting for commentary from jimjag

    * snarf rules.mk(.in) from APRUTIL to simplify makefiles
        Status: Greg +1 (volunteers), Sascha +1, rbb -0.5

    * add apr_crypt() and APR_HAS_CRYPT for apps to determine whether the
      crypt() function is available, and a way to call it (whether it is
      located in libc, libcrypt, or libufc)
        Status: Greg +1 (volunteers)

    * apr_dso_load() should (uniformly) add a cleanup to unload the DSO.
      Currently, the per-platform DSO loading is inconsistent in this
      regard.

    * apr_create_lock() changes:
      - It ignores the "type" parameter, so toss it.
      - The fname param is allowed to be NULL on the Unix platform.
        Change it to always use the passed value, and check callers.


Documentation that needs writing:

    * API documentation
