Changes with APR b1
  *) apr_getaddrinfo() can now return multiple addresses for a host
     via the next field in apr_sockaddr_t.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Tighten up the check for getaddrinfo().  If it can't figure out
     the appropriate address family for 127.0.0.1, it fails.  
     Unfortunately, Tru64 fails this test so we won't do IPv6 on
     Tru64.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Rename apr_opendir to apr_dir_open.  [Ryan Bloom]

  *) apr_snprintf()'s %pI format string now takes apr_sockaddr_t *
     instead of sockaddr_in *.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a bug in apr_accept() for Win32 and Unix where the local 
     apr_sockaddr_t in the new connected socket was not initialized
     properly.  This could result in a bad string for apr_get_ipaddr(),
     among other things.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add apr_getnameinfo(), a replacement for apr_get_hostname() which
     supports IPv6 and will be friendlier for use with eventual 
     SOCK_DGRAM support.  apr_get_hostname() is gone.  [Jeff Trawick]

Changes with APR a9

  *) Removed the iconv implementation from the i18n/unix/iconv branch.
     This now resides in the apr-iconv repository, and will be ported
     over time to use native apr types (e.g. apr_dso) for portability.

  *) Only support IPv6 if we have sockaddr_in and a working 
     getaddrinfo().  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add apr_parse_addr_port() for parsing the hostname:port portion
     of URLs and similar strings.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add Win32 MMAP support [William Rowe]

  *) Allow the APR programmer to specify if the MMAP is read-only or
     write-able.
     [Ryan Bloom and Will Rowe]

  *) Check more carefully for getaddrinfo().  Accept those that
     require <netdb.h> to be included (e.g., Tru64).  Reject those that 
     fail a very basic operational test (e.g., AIX).  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add apr_make_os_sock() for constructing a fully-capable APR
     socket.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Make APR's shared memory routines always allocate enough memory
     for the requested segment, the MM internal types, and the APR
     internal types.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Add APR_SIZE_T_FMT.  Get the other APR_xx_T_FMT variables
     defined properly on AIX.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) network API changes: get rid of apr_get_socket_inaddr(), 
     apr_get_remote_name(), and apr_get_local_name()  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add a step at configure time to create a file at the top-level,
     apr.exports, which lists every function exported by APR.  The
     file is generated by a script in helpers, that reads each header
     file.
     [Ryan Bloom]

  *) Lock config changes: Detect SysV sem capability by the presence of
     sempaphore functions, not by the presence of union semun.  New
     config variable apr_lock_method can override autodetection of the 
     apr_lock implementation method.  For now, hints.m4 uses it to select 
     SysV semaphores for OS/390.  New config variable 
     apr_process_lock_is_global specifies that the selected inter-process
     lock method is sufficient for APR_LOCKALL (i.e., it blocks all
     threads and processes).  For now, hints.m4 turns on this flag for
     OS/390.  [Jeff Trawick]
     
  *) Get APR_OFF_T_FMT defined properly on Solaris Sparc.
     [Jeff Trawick]

Changes with APR a8
  *) Change the name of the sa_len field in apr_sockaddr_t to salen.
     Some platforms have a macro named sa_len.
     [Tony Finch]

  *) apr_set_port(), apr_get_port(), apr_set_ipaddr(), and apr_get_ipaddr()
     now take apr_sockaddr_t as a parameter instead of apr_socket_t +
     apr_interface_e.  This will allow the same routines to be used with
     datagram APIs to be added later.  Note that code which calls 
     apr_set_ipaddr() should probably be changed to call apr_getaddrinfo()
     for protocol independence.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) apr_create_tcp_socket() has been removed.  Use apr_create_socket()
     instead.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Source was moved from the apache-2.0 repository.  For all CHANGES
     prior to this time, please see the apache-2.0 repository
