Changes for APR 1.1.1

  *) Switch to lazy initialization of the pollset that's used within
     apr_file_t on platforms where apr_wait_for_io_or_timeout() doesn't
     use poll(2).  (This fixes a performance problem observed in httpd-2.x
     on OS X due to the use of poll now being disabled by default on that
     platform.)  [Brian Pane]

  *) Support APR_SO_SNDBUF and APR_SO_RCVBUF on Windows.  PR 32177.
     [Sim <sgobbi datamanagement.it>, Jeff Trawick]

  *) Disable sendfile support for S/390 only in kernel versions < 2.4.0. 
     [Joe Orton]

  *) Fix posix rwlock detection on Darwin. [Aaron Bannert]

  *) Build fix for Multicast support on HP-UX 11.00 and Tru64 [Joe Orton]

  *) Fix libapr.rc for Win32 builds [William Rowe]

  *) Rewrite apr_file_writev_full using apr_file_write_full. [Paul Querna]

  *) Use APR_RING_CONCAT for moving dead list in KQueue, sys_epoll, and 
     Event Ports. [Paul Querna]

  *) find_apr.m4: Try installed APR before bundled copy if --with-apr not
     passed to configure.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Fix issue with poll() followed by net I/O yielding EAGAIN on
     Mac OS 10.4 (Darwin 8). [Wilfredo Sanchez]

Changes for APR 1.1.0

  *) Added apr_procattr_user_set and apr_procattr_group_set
     setting the user and group for new processes.  [Mladen Turk]

  *) Add APR Multicast functions; including support for
     Source-Specific Multicast from Colm MacCarthaigh.  [Paul Querna]

  *) Add a build script to create a solaris package.  [Graham Leggett]
  
  *) Add support for APR_TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT.  [Paul Querna]

  *) Rename the apr_file_permissions macros (APR_UREAD, APR_UWRITE etc.)
     to have prefix APR_FPROT_ (old names kept for compatibility).
     [Stas Bekman]

  *) Emit the run-time link path option in apr-config after installation
     if the user is linking with libtool.  [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Add apr_file_writev_full to ensure an entire iovec is writen to a file.
     [Paul Querna]

  *) Remove the runtime test for Sendfile versions on FreeBSD. PR 25718.
     [Mike Silbersack <silby silby.com>, Paul Querna]

  *) Rename the apr_file_open macros (APR_READ, APR_WRITE, etc.) to
     have prefix APR_FOPEN_ (old names kept for compatibility).
     [Stas Bekman]

  *) Added apr_os_uuid_get() support for Linux via libuuid and for modern 
     BSDs which have uuid_create as part of their libc.  [Paul Querna]

  *) Added Solaris 10 'Event Ports' as a backend for APR Pollset.  This 
     backend also supports the APR_POLLSET_THREADSAFE flag.  [Paul Querna]

  *) Added the APR_POLLSET_THREADSAFE flag. This allows multiple threads
     to call the Pollset Add or Remove functions in a thread safe manner.
     Currently only EPoll and KQueue support this flag.  [Paul Querna]

  *) Split poll/unix/poll.c into separate files for each Poll or Pollset 
     implementation. [Paul Querna]

  *) Rewrite apr_file_printf to handle arbitrary length strings.
     PR 28029.  [Chris Knight <Christopher.D.Knight nasa.gov>,
     Garrett Rooney <rooneg electricjellyfish.net>]
