Apache Portable Runtime
=======================


Using a Subversion Checkout on Unix
===================================

If you are building APR from SVN, you need to perform a prerequisite
step.  You must have autoconf, libtool and python installed for this 
to work.  The prerequisite is simply;

  ./buildconf

If you are building APR from a distribution tarball, buildconf is
already run for you, and you do not need autoconf, libtool or python
installed or to run buildconf unless you have patched APR's buildconf 
inputs (such as configure.in, build.conf, virtually any file within 
the build/ tree, or you add or remove source files).

Remember when updating from svn that you must rerun ./buildconf again 
to effect any changes made to the build schema in your fresh update.


Configuring and Building APR on Unix
====================================

Simply;

   ./configure --prefix=/desired/path/of/apr
   make
   make test
   make install

Configure has additional options, ./configure --help will offer you
those choices.  You may also add CC=compiler CFLAGS="compiler flags"
etc. prior to the ./configure statement (on the same line).  Please
be warned, some flags must be passed as part of the CC command,
itself, in order for autoconf to make the right determinations. Eg.;

  CC="gcc -m64" ./configure --prefix=/desired/path/of/apr

will inform APR that you are compiling to a 64 bit CPU, and autoconf
must consider that when setting up all of APR's internal and external
type declarations.

For more verbose output from testall, you may wish to invoke testall
with the flag;

   cd test
   ./testall -v


Generating Test Coverage information with gcc
=============================================

If you want to generate test coverage data, use the following steps:

  ./buildconf
  CFLAGS="-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage" ./configure
  make
  cd test
  make
  ./testall
  cd ..
  make gcov
