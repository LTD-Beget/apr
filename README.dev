Apache Portable Runtime
=======================

Right now, if you are building APR, it means that you are probably a
developer.  If you are building it as a standalone package, however,
this means using a slightly non-standard build process.  

1) ./buildconf
2) ./configure
3) make

Currently, there is no make install step, as APR is not yet
installable.
