 Changes between 1.0.6 and 1.0.7 (06-Jun-1999 to 22-Jun-1999)

  *) Upgraded to latest shtool 1.3.0-dev
  *) Avoid -g under non-debugging situation
  *) Complain with a fatal error message when MM_SHM_MAXSEGSIZE
     couldn't be determined.
  *) Updated config.guess/config.sub

 Changes between 1.0.5 and 1.0.6 (02-Jun-1999 to 06-Jun-1999)

  *) Fixed internal best-fit algorithm for finding a free memory chunk: 
     - things got inserted out of order in the list
     - when chunk is found which matches size exactly it stops immediately
