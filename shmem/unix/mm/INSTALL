  MM - Shared Memory Library

  To install the MM library into /path/to/mm/{bin,lib,include,man}/ perform
  the following steps in your shell:
      
    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/mm
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

  This installs at least a static variant of the MM library and when your
  platforms support it, also a shared library variant of the MM library.
