  MM - Shared Memory Library
  Copyright (c) 1999-2000 Ralf S. Engelschall, All rights reserved.
  Version 1.1.1 (30-Apr-2000)

  The MM library is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the usage
  of shared memory between forked (and this way strongly related) processes
  under Unix platforms. On the first (lower) layer it hides all platform
  dependent implementation details (allocation and locking) when dealing with
  shared memory segments and on the second (higher) layer it provides a
  high-level malloc(3)-style API for a convenient and well known way to work
  with data-structures inside those shared memory segments. 

  This library was successfully tested on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, BSDI,
  Linux, SunOS, Solaris, Tru64, AIX, A/UX, HP-UX, ReliantUNIX, IRIX, UnixWare
  and even Win32 Cygwin, BeOS and OS/390.
