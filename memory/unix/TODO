This is just a small list of things yet to be done, or things
that we may want/need to consider.  I haven't put it in the
STATUS file for APR as none of these can be considered
showstoppers for the time being.

- we need to add dynamic loading ability for memory
  systems.  As to how it should be done this needs to be
  looked at.  Some known issues include 
    o differing arguments for create functions

  Just to clarify why this will be very cool if we can get
  it working, we give the user the ability to use 3rd party modules
  that can actually have almost total control over how the
  memory is allocated. Not sure I know of other libraries where
  this is possible.

- given the problems that can occur when trying to find 
  alloc/free problems we should probably have a special debug
  memory system that records everything it does and any
  other information we think is useful.

- in addition to the debugging system, we need to look at
  methods of checking memory allocations to ensure we're
  behaving when we have the ASSERT_MEMORY flag turned on.
  The pools in 1.3 had code from dean and Roy, Greg has added
  some special stuff for pools under Linux on 2.0, so we just
  need some ideas
